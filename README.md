# Dynamic Live-Action E-Books

Welcome to the Dynamic Live-Action E-Books Hackathon!

Your goal is to create an audio e-book where the storyline adapts in real-time based on listener choices. Users will be asked what story they want to hear, followed by some configuration, and then they will start listening. At certain moments, they will be asked to choose what the hero of the story must do. Based on their decisions, the story will dynamically adjust.

In this project, you will integrate ElevenLabs for narration and OpenAI for story generation. This project will help you develop skills in API integration, natural language processing, and real-time data handling.

## Project Setup and Initial Brainstorming

1. **Set Up Project Repository**: Ensure that all necessary files and dependencies are included.
2. **Conduct Initial Brainstorming**: Identify the key components and features of the dynamic live-action e-book. Document your findings and create a project plan.

## Tasks

1. **Create UI and branding**: We should have dedicated UI for our app.
2. **Design landing page**: Landing page should have a possibility of gathering emails, and display demo of our product.
3. **Integrate OpenAI for Dynamic Story Branching**: Enable dynamic story branching based on user choices.
4. **Develop Decision-Making Interface**: Develop an interface that allows users to make decisions at certain points in the story.
5. **Implement Real-Time Voice Generation with ElevenLabs**: Integrate ElevenLabs to generate real-time narration for the e-book.
6. **Build Backend for Story Logic**: Build the backend logic that handles the dynamic adjustments of the story based on user decisions.
7. **Create product pitch deck**: We need to have slides.
